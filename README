README for MusuGPS:

This is a debug version : the map API needs an API key, and the one used here was set for debug.
Some improvement is needed when it comes to data structures. Right now, I guess too much messages will severely impact
performance, and might even break the application.

Two activities are defined, though the only one actually used is SharedGPSActivity, which you can access from Musubi.
The plan was originally to send messages from Musubi, but to visualize data in a separate activity. However, it was
simpler to do both in the same activity accessed from Musubi.

There are many points of improvement, please read the associated final report to see some leads on how to do so.
